File Modes
"r": Opens a file for reading. The file must exist.
"w": Opens a file for writing. If the file exists, its previous contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.
"a": Opens a file for appending. Data is written at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.
"r+": Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file must exist.
"w+": Opens a file for both reading and writing. If the file exists, its previous contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.
"a+": Opens a file for both reading and appending. Data can be read or written at any position in the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.
